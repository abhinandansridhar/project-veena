**Date:** 2025-06-02  
**Start Time:** 10:48 AM   
**Focus of the Session:** Alex Screenplay v3  
**What I Did:** Made progress on the screenplay. Basically did a second round on the scene. Then, I did a Nothing Hour where I clarified my stance on Megha 2's arc.   
**Mood (Before → After):** Uncertain -> Light  
**Distractions / Resistance:** Few / Negligible     
**One Line Summary:** The mighty wheel shows signs of motion... It's slow but it's noticeable.
