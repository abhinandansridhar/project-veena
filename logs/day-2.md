# Project Veena – Day 2

**Date:** 2025-06-03  
**Start Time:** 4:30 PM  
**Focus of the Session:** Voiceover for Sharath  
**What I Did:** I sat in Ani's room and wrote a voiceover for Sharath's pickle ad. It's about a girl reminiscing about her grandma. It's centered around how she's forgetting her grandma, and the pickle brings back memories of her.  
**Mood (Before → After):**  Meh -> Not Meh  
**Distractions / Resistance:** A few. Ani being around made it harder for me to zone in. But it eventually happened. The 75 min focusmate session helped.   
**One Line Summary:** Pickle ad - didn't go bad.
